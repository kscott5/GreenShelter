	# WinMerge Command-Line Options - http://manual.winmerge.org/Command_line.html
	#
	# /e enables you to close WinMerge with a single Esc key press.
	# /x closes WinMerge (after displaying an information dialog) when you start a comparison of identical files. 
	# /s limits WinMerge windows to a single instance. For example, if WinMerge is already running, a new compare opens in the same instance.
	# /u prevents WinMerge from adding either path (left or right) to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list.
	# /wl opens the left side as read-only. Use this when you don't want to change left side items in the compare.
	# /maximize starts WinMerge as a maximized window.
	# /dl specifies a description in the left side title bar, overriding the default folder or filename text. For example: /dl "Version 1.0" or /dl WorkingCopy. Use quotation marks around descriptions that contain spaces.
	# /dr specifies a description in the right side title bar, just like /dl.
	#
	# To difftool all change: 			c:\>git difftool
